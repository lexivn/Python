CODE PRACTICE 4: STRINGS

Assume that you’ve run the following statements:

>>> str1 = 'hello, '
>>> str2 = 'how are you?'
>>> str3 = str1 + str2
To practice what you’ve learned, without using Python’s shell, work out on your own what the following statements would return:

str3 = [hello, how are you?]

str3[3:]
Result: [lo, how are you?]

str3[-3:]
Result: [ou?]

str3[2:9:3]
Result: [l,oa]

str3[::-2]
Result: [?o r o olh]

str3[2:8]
Result: [llo, h]

1. Make a note of your answers in a text document.
2. Create a sub folder inside your “Exercise 1.2” folder and name it “1.2-Practice Task 4” or something similar. Upload your text document or a screenshot of your answers in this folder.
