## Install Python

First, install Python 3.9.X in your system. Chec your Python version by using the command `python --version` from your terminal.

## Set Up a Virtual Environment

Set up a new virtual environment named "cf-python-base"
![Step 2](./Achievement%201/Exercise%201.1/Step2.png)

## Create a Python Script

Install Visual Studio Code or another text editor of your choice and create a Python script named “add.py”. This script will take two numbers from the user input, add them, and print the result. Here's the template for your Python script:

![Step 3](./Achievement%201/Exercise%201.1/Step3.png)

```python
# Prompt the user to enter the first number
a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Prompt the user to enter the second number
b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Add the two numbers and store the result in variable c
c = a + b

# Print the value of c
print("The sum of", a, "and", b, "is:", c)
```

## Set Up IPython Shell

Set up an IPython shell in the virtual environment "cf-python-base". An IPython shell is similar to the regular Python REPL with additional features like syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and robust auto-complete features. Install it using pip.

## Export a Requirements File

Generate a “requirements.txt” file from your source environment. Next, create a new environment called “cf-python-copy”. In this new environment, install packages from the “requirements.txt” file.

1. [Create the Data Structure](#create-the-data-structure)
2. [Create recipe_1](#create-recipe_1)
3. [Create Outer Structure](#create-outer-structure)
4. [Create 4 More Recipes](#create-4-more-recipes)
5. [Print Ingredient Lists](#print-ingredient-lists)

## Create the Data Structure

- Create a structure named recipe_1 that contains the following keys:
  - name (str): Contains the name of the recipe
  - cooking_time (int): Contains the cooking time in minutes
  - ingredients (list): Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type

![step 1](./Achievement%201/Exercise%201.2/Step1.png)

_A dictionary is suitable because it provides a key-value structure to associate recipe attributes. It allows easy access to specific information using keys. Dictionaries support different data types, accommodating strings, integers, and lists for recipe name, cooking time, and ingredients, respectively. The structure maintains organization and consistency, particularly useful when storing multiple recipes in a container like a list. Overall, using a dictionary facilitates convenient manipulation and structured access to recipe data, enabling further operations and analysis._

## Create recipe_1

![step 2](./Achievement%201/Exercise%201.2/Step2.png)

## Create outer Structure

Create an outer structure called all_recipes, and then add recipe_1 to it.

![step 3](./Achievement%201/Exercise%201.2/Step3.png)

_Using a list provides a sequential and dynamic structure, allowing easy modification and retrieval of recipes based on their order. Lists support iteration and indexing, enabling convenient operations on individual recipes or the entire collection. The versatility of lists accommodates recipes of varying lengths and complexities, making it suitable for a diverse range of recipe structures. Overall, a list provides the flexibility, scalability, and ease of access required for managing and modifying multiple recipes._

## Create 4 More Recipes

Generate 4 more recipes as recipe_2, recipe_3, recipe_4, and recipe_5, and then add them as well to all_recipes.

![step 4](./Achievement%201/Exercise%201.2/Step4.png)

## Print Ingredient Lists

Print the ingredients of each recipe as five different lists, inside the IPython shell.
